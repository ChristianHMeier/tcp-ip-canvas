# tcp-ip-canvas

Thesis project for MSc in Global Software Development in Hochschule Fulda.

Inspired by the Selective Repeat / Go Back N Web app developed by Johannes Kessler for [CCS Labs](https://www.ccs-labs.org/teaching/rn/animations/gbn_sr/)

The Web application is meant to help in the teaching of congestion control algorithms through exploratory learning. Upon release, it provides Reno, CUBIC and BBR representations. The Web application is built to be extendable, so Developers and Academics interested in adding new congestion control algorithms can do so by creating a child class of CongestionControl in the /js/classes/congestion-control/ folder, and adding it to the list provided in the index.js file within that folder.
